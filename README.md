This repository demonstrates a common SQL syntax error that can occur in the `WHERE` clause when comparing a column value to a literal value. The provided `bug.sql` file showcases the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` offers the corrected version. The error arises from the missing column name after the `AND` operator. The solution highlights the importance of properly specifying column names when using multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
